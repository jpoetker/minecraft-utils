Helpers for creating forge minecraft mods.

Simply put, I am helping my son with a [forge minecraft mod](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.15.x/). This lib contains some utilities and helper functions that we've started to compile to make life a little easier. Some of these are lifted from [TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample](https://github.com/TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample/tree/master/src/main/java/minecraftbyexample).
